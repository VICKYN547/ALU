## ⚙️ Simulation Setup

Follow these steps to simulate and visualize the logic gates:

**1. Requirements**

i. **Icarus Verilog:** A powerful open-source Verilog simulator.

**2. Compilation and Simulation**

Run the following commands in your terminal:

Step 1: Compile the testbench
```python
  iverilog -o logic_gates.vvp logic_gates_tb.v
```

Step 2: Run the simulation
```python
  vvp logic_gates.vvp
```

Step 3: Generate the waveform (**`logic_gates.vcd`** is created automatically)

**3. View Waveforms**

Open the generated logic_gates.vcd file in GTKWave:
```python
  gtkwave logic_gates.vcd
```

Explore the waveforms of each logic gate and validate their functionality visually! 📈

## 📋 Logic Gates Implementation

The **`logic_gates.v`** file defines basic logic gates:

**AND Gate:** Outputs 1 if both inputs are 1.

**OR Gate:** Outputs 1 if either input is 1.

**NOT Gate:** Outputs the inverse of the input.

**NAND Gate:** Outputs 1 unless both inputs are 1.

**NOR Gate:** Outputs 1 if neither input is 1.

**XOR Gate:** Outputs 1 if inputs are different.

**XNOR Gate:** Outputs 1 if inputs are the same.

## 📜 Testbench Overview

The **`logic_gates_tb.v`** file includes a testbench to verify the functionality of all gates. Here's what it does:

Initializes a set of test cases for inputs a and b.

Dumps the results into a **`.vcd`** file for waveform analysis.

Displays the results in a tabular format for quick reference.
